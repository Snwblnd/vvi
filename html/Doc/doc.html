      <h2>Picking an organization</h2>

      <p>
        Finding an organization with a problem is not really difficult
        in times like these. The real difficulty was finding one
        where I could provide a feasable solution. Since I am part
        of a community I decided to take a look there first, our local
        fire department. To answer the question as to why I picked this
        organization over others: I live in a rural area, and there
        are so few organizations in our vicinity, and after considering
        which ones I actually could help I chose the one where I was a
        part of and could understand the problem from my own perspective.
      </p>

      <h2>Identifying the problem</h2>

      <p>
        I identified current problems by simply listening. During one
        of our meetings, some trainees complained about not having
        enough time to prepare for their exam to become a fire fighter.
        At first I suggested to develop an e-learning platform, but a
        solution like that already exists (Moodle e.g.), and our F.D.
        was already working on an implementation. After practice I
        noticed that I never really knew where any of our tools where.
        This is where I was sure that a generic solution like Moodle
        didn't already exist, and even if it did, it was difficult
        to implement due to the complexicity of our vehicles.
      </p>

      <h2>Developing an approach</h2>

      <p>
        This step was a little tougher. I considered many ways to help
        someone memorize positions of tools in our vehicles. This went
        from

        <ul>
          <li>Taking pictures of the tools and pointing with an arrow to the position in the vehicle</li>
          <li>Creating some sort of minigame, where the user has to drag images in a table of which shutter the tool is located in</li>
          <li>Just a list of tools, what they are used for, and where they're located.</li>
        </ul>

      No solution satisfied me, as it required taking tons of
      pictures, and gets difficult to implement as sometimes a tool
      can be in multiple locations, or is behind some layer that is
      easy to spot in an image with an arrow pointing to it, but
      difficult to find in reality.

      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up deciding to try to make it an interactive
        experience. I knew beforehand that this would require the most
        amount of work, but I wouldn't have done this if I wasn't
        convinced that this would help someone like me remember tools
        positions the best. My first step was preparations. I needed
        to learn 3D modelling. Luckily I had a friend who showed me the
        basics in Fusion3D. Despite how basic my vehicle looks, and
        how few of the tools I actually made, this step was the most
        time-consuming. It took several attempts to get a result
        that was even useable. Next step was to decide on a platform.
        <br>I considered the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile</li>
          <li>Desktop Application</li>
          <li>Website</li>
        </ul>
        Almost everyone has a phone. The problems with phones however
        were the screen size, I was unsure of how I would create an
        UI that had enough space for text, without being too small
        and not covering up the vehicle, and controls/gestures seemed
        to be very complicated to implement.
        <br>
        A desktop application seemed like a good idea at first, but
        since some trainees are very unfamiliar with computers, I
        decided it'd be best to not develop something that would have
        to be downloaded first and installed.
        <br>
        The last idea was a website. This seemed like a good idea,
        because it works with the majority of operating systems and
        browsers, is lightweight and easy to access. The last step was
        to figure out how I could create an interactive experience
        within a website. After looking into the topic a bit further,
        I found out that WebGL would be able to handle the job. My
        idea was to create all of this in a game engine that could
        work with WebGL. While both Unity and Unreal Engine are capable
        of this, I went with Unity because It seemed easier to learn at
        first. Unity was able to import my 3D Model with all of its
        subcomponents without an issue, so the first thing I had to
        test was if it would actually work in a WebGL Environment.
        After testing it in different situations I found out that it
        worked if hosted on a webserver, but opening the file directly
        never worked and strangely enough Firefox on Ubuntu had its
        difficulties too, but not on Windows.
        <br>
        Next I had to implement a way to inspect the vehicle from
        multiple angles and positions. One option was to create a first
        person controller, where I could virtually walk around the
        vehicle, like in a game. This would've offered an easy VR
        adaption, but as most households don't actually have a
        VR-Headset I decided to use more commonly used browser controls:
        Spinning the vehicle with your mouse and zooming with your
        scrolling wheel.
        <br>
        After that was done I needed to look for a way to enable my
        mouse again, leave the "spin mode" and use it to hover over
        any tools. I gave every tool a mesh collider, which basically
        tells Unity how something is shaped based on its mesh.
        Unity provides a simple OnMouseOver-Method, so getting a
        detection as to when my mouse hovers a tool was easy. I only
        needed to create a UI with dynamic text. This was difficult
        at first, because the text was either behind the background,
        behind the vehicle, blurry or badly positioned, depending on
        the screen size. I solved all of this by putting it as close
        to the camera as possible. Exported it to WebGL and everything
        worked as intended.
        <br>
        Last step was to create a Website where I could actually
        embed the whole project. The most time-consuming part was to
        actually design it first, because this time design actually
        mattered and I haven't done that too often.
      </p>
      <h2>Previous Skillset</h2>

      <p>
        Previously I learned how to program with java and C++, and the
        basics about CSS and HTML in school. At home I taught myself a
        lot more about Java, C#, Python and SQL. I worked a lot with
        Android Studio and even published an App, and this is where I
        taught I knew something about managing projects, but more to
        that later.
      </p>

    <h2>What I've learned</h2>

    <p>
      Prior to this project I had no experience with 3D-Modelling nor
      Game Development. Even though it took me a long time to grasp
      the concepts of working with Autodesk Fusion, it was fun and
      refreshing because I could see my own progress. Looking at my
      vehicle I'm fully aware of how big the room for improvement is,
      but for my first time modelling something like this I'm
      satisfied. Learning Unity, or rather how to work with Unity
      was rather easy, as there's plenty of tutorials for that on
      Youtube, and my "Game" was really simple. But the one thing
      where I'm pretty sure I learned the most is Project Management.
      After reading the email carefully, I stumbled upon
      "Version Control" and had to look it up. It's my first time
      actually working with GitHub, so not everything is really clear
      to me, and I probably did some things the wrong way, but most
      of it made sense as to why I should use it and I wish I had
      known sooner about this. Now I know how to work on a Project
      with multiple people working on different features, how version
      control ensures that a rollback is the solution to a broken
      feature instead of CTRL+Z, it all makes a bit more sense now.
      In hindsight I feel really uneducated on how I've handled
      things before knowing about GitHub, but I'm glad I know about it now.
    </p>

    <h2>The best solution?</h2>

    <p>
      Of course this isn't the best solution, but I think the
      approach is good and makes it actually possible to work on
      current issues. With more time and patience, I could've
      completed the vehicle, with all of its moving drawers, and
      give it a better design. Unity makes it possible to actually
      open things like drawers, or other mechanical parts to showcase
      the vehicle. It also makes it possible to add more vehicles in
      the same way, and to create a better environment instead of a
      black background. Another advantage that comes with unity is
      the ways I can improve the whole experience, not just the
      content. Instead of only being able to spin the vehicle with
      your mouse, I could move the point where the camera pivots
      around. Highlighting tools and creating a quiz should be
      possible too, but it'd take me more time, so I decided against
      doing this for now.
